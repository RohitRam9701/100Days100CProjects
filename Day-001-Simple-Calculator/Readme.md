# Day-001-Simple-Calculator

## Project Description

Welcome to Day 1 of the "100 Days, 100 C Projects" challenge! Today, we are creating a simple calculator program in C. This project is part of our journey into C programming mastery, where we aim to strengthen our coding skills and build a diverse portfolio of projects.

## Project Overview

The Simple Calculator project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus on two numbers. It includes the following functionalities:

- Addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction of two numbers.
- Multiplication of two numbers.
- Division of two numbers.
- Modulus operation on two numbers.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.c`: Contains the main program logic where user input is taken and operations are performed.
- `myCalculator.h`: Header file containing function prototypes for arithmetic operations.
- `myCalculator.c`: Source file containing function definitions for arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

To run the Simple Calculator program:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC), using command "gcc main.c myCalculator.c -o Simple-Calculator"
4. Run the executable file.

## How to Use

1. Launch the program.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. View the result of the selected operation.
