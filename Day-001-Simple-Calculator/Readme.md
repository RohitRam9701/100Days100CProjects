# Day-001-Simple-Calculator

## Project Description

Welcome to Day 1 of the "100 Days, 100 C Projects" challenge! Today, I'm creating a simple calculator program in C. This project is part of our journey into C programming mastery, where I aim to strengthen coding skills and build a diverse portfolio of projects.

## Project Overview

The Simple Calculator project allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus on two numbers. It includes the following functionalities:

- Addition of two numbers.
- Subtraction of two numbers.
- Multiplication of two numbers.
- Division of two numbers.
- Modulus operation on two numbers.

**Note**: The project is designed to be compiled and executed using only GCC commands for compilation, linking, and running the program. No build systems like Makefiles or CMake are utilized in this specific project, emphasizing direct command-line compilation with GCC.

This project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice compiling C programs using GCC commands, understanding the compilation process, and managing dependencies manually.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `main.c`: Contains the main program logic where user input is taken and operations are performed.
- `myCalculator.h`: Header file containing function prototypes for arithmetic operations.
- `myCalculator.c`: Source file containing function definitions for arithmetic operations.

## Getting Started

To run the Simple Calculator program:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC), using command "gcc main.c myCalculator.c -o Simple-Calculator"
4. Run the executable file.

## How to Use

1. Launch the program.
2. Enter two numbers when prompted.
3. View the result of the selected operation.
