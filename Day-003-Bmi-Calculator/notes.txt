BMI formula

Below are the equations used for calculating BMI in the International System of Units (SI) and the US customary system (USC) using a 5'10", 160-pound individual as an example:
USC Units:
BMI = 703 ×  	
mass (lbs)
height2 (in)
	= 703 ×  	
160
702
	= 22.96  	
kg
m2
SI, Metric Units:
BMI =  	
mass (kg)
height2 (m)
	 =  	
72.57
1.782
	 =  	22.90

BMI Prime

BMI prime is the ratio of a person's measured BMI to the upper limit of BMI that is considered "normal," by institutions such as the WHO and the CDC. Though it may differ in some countries, such as those in Asia, this upper limit, which will be referred to as BMIupper is 25 kg/m2.

The BMI prime formula is:
BMI prime =
